        <p>Mayday PAC  <a href="http://mayday.us/">(MAYDAY.US)</a> is a movement of citizens dedicated to ending the system of corruption in Washington, D.C. by changing the way campaigns are funded.</p>
        <p>In 2014, Mayday launched a &ldquo;super PAC to end all super PACs.&rdquo; From over 65,000 contributions, we crowdfunded close to $12,000,000 to support an experiment in reform. Entering eight races across the country, we campaigned for reformers, and tried to show that Americans would vote for reform because Americans are tired the corruption in Washington. </p>
        <p>Americans <em>are</em> tired of that corruption, but we didn’t move voters enough to convince the skeptics that reform was an issue that could win. Too often, the strong desire that voters showed for reform got swamped by partisanship. And as most can’t see how Congress could even fix the system, most have little reason to vote for someone because they promise a fix.</p>
        <p>That experience taught us a great deal. First, we need to frame this issue outside of a partisan fight. Second, we need to get close enough to winning in Congress, so that idea of reform is not just a dream. </p>
        <p>In 2015, we are acting on this second lesson first. We will experiment with a wide range of techniques to get Members of Congress to commit to fundamental reform, by cosponsoring at least one of <a href="http://www.repswith.us/reforms" target="_blank">5 proposals for reform</a>. If we can close the gap between the number supporting reform and a majority in Congress, then in 2016, we can focus our campaign on a fight that seems winnable.</p>
